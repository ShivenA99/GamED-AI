The left container is prominently labeled 'TCP Protocol' and the right container is labeled 'UDP Protocol'. Both containers are empty, ready to receive elements, and are visually distinct but harmoniously integrated into a single network-themed background, perhaps with subtle data flow lines or network nodes in the background, but not distracting from the main containers. The overall aesthetic should be digital and schematic.",
