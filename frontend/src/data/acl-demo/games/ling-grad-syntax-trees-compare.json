    "narrativeIntro": "Welcome, graduate student, to the Syntactic Architect's workshop! Your mission is to dissect and reconstruct the same sentence across four foundational syntactic theories: Government & Binding, Minimalist Program, HPSG, and LFG. By understanding their unique blueprints, you'll master the art of comparative syntactic analysis. Let's begin with 'The student quickly read the book.'",

    "completionMessage": "Congratulations, Syntactic Architect! You have successfully navigated the complex landscapes of theoretical syntax, demonstrating a profound understanding of how different frameworks represent the same linguistic reality. Your ability to compare, contrast, and synthesize these theories is truly exceptional.",

      "assetPrompt": "A simplified, yet structurally accurate, X-bar tree diagram for the sentence 'The student quickly read the book.'. The diagram should clearly show hierarchical branching, with nodes representing syntactic categories (e.g., NP, VP, CP, DP, AdvP) and lexical items (N, V, D, Adv). Specific areas corresponding to XP, X-bar, X, Specifier, Complement, and Adjunct positions should be visually distinct and clearly delineated as interactive zones, ready for labeling and description matching. The sentence itself should be visibly integrated at the terminal nodes.",
