The sentence is presented in a clear, sans-serif font. Specific phrases within the sentence are clearly delineated and visually distinct, forming interactive zones for grammatical analysis. The phrase 'The quick brown fox' is subtly highlighted as one zone. The phrase 'jumps over the lazy dog' is another distinct zone. The word 'over' is clearly marked as a separate zone. The words 'quick', 'brown', and 'lazy' are collectively highlighted as a single conceptual zone representing adjectives, ensuring all four required labels have a distinct target area.",
