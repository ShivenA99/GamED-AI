        "zone_adams_bashforth_method_area": "As an explicit multistep method, it achieves higher orders of accuracy efficiently by reusing past solution points, making it suitable for smooth problems where computational cost per step is a concern, but it requires special initialization and can have specific stability limitations.",
        "zone_implicit_methods_area": "These methods are primarily chosen for their exceptional stability properties, particularly for stiff differential equations, often allowing much larger step sizes than explicit methods. However, each step involves solving a potentially complex algebraic equation, increasing the computational cost per step."
