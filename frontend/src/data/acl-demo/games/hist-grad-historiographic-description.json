It features six clearly delineated, distinct, and visually unique zones, each subtly shaped to suggest its conceptual identity (e.g., one zone might have 'layers' for class analysis, another 'interconnected paths' for long-term structures). Each zone is clearly labeled with its methodology name. The overall aesthetic is clean, modern, and suitable for an educational context, with ample space within and around each zone for dropping text cards.",
