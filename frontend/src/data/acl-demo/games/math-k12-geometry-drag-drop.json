Each triangle must have clearly delineated segments for its sides, distinct points for its vertices, and clearly marked arcs for its angles. The diagram must provide distinct, highlightable zones for at least two 'Side' segments, two 'Vertex' points, one 'Acute Angle', one 'Right Angle', and one 'Obtuse Angle' across the three triangles, ensuring enough unique targets for labeling.",
