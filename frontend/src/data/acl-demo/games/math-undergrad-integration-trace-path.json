It begins with a node representing the standard form, progresses through distinct, clearly separated nodes for coefficient identification, discriminant calculation, quadratic formula application, square root simplification, and concludes with nodes for calculating the final solutions. Each step is contained within a clean, rectangular box or node, and these nodes are connected by prominent, clear directional arrows indicating the logical flow. The diagram should be visually balanced to accommodate interactive elements for tracing, description matching, and drag-and-drop activities.",
