It should clearly depict a sender computer connected to a local network via a Network Interface Card (NIC), then to a Switch, a Router, and a Modem. This local network should then connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP), which leads to the Internet Backbone. The backbone then connects to a Destination ISP, another Modem, and finally a Receiver Computer. The diagram should visually suggest the flow of data from sender to receiver, possibly with subtle directional arrows or a 'path' line. Each component should be distinct and visually recognizable, even in a simplified form.",
