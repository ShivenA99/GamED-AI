The graph must distinctly display: a jump discontinuity (a clear break where the function value 'jumps'), a sharp corner (cusp) or a point with a vertical tangent (where the function is continuous but not differentiable), a segment that is visibly smooth and continuous (and thus differentiable), and another segment that is continuous but contains a sharp corner or vertical tangent (making it not differentiable at that specific point). The overall composition should allow for clear interactive zones around these specific points and segments.",
