# Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium)

## Problem:

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) that is rotated at an unknown pivot.

Given nums and an integer target, return the index of target if it exists, or -1 otherwise.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime.

## Example:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0  Output: 4

## Question:

For nums = [6,7,8,1,2,3,4,5] and target = 3, what index will be returned?

A. 1

B. 2

C. 5 ✅

D. -1

## Concept Check:

Which method ensures logarithmic runtime?

A. Binary Search ✅

B. Linear Search

C. Hash Map Lookup

D. Divide & Multiply
