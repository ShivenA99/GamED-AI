### Template Context: PROBABILITY_LAB

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Interactive probability experiments and simulations.
- Experiments are runnable simulations.
- Results are visualized in charts or graphs.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Focus on probability, statistics, and experimental outcomes.
- Visual elements should represent experiments, parameters, and results.
- Questions should involve predicting probabilities or understanding outcomes.
- Animation cues should show experiment runs, result updates, and statistical visualization.
