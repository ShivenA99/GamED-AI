### Template Context: MATRIX_MATCH

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Match items across rows and columns in a matrix grid.
- Cells represent relationships between row and column items.
- Selecting row and column creates a match.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Emphasize two-dimensional relationships and correlations.
- Visual elements should represent matrix structure with rows and columns.
- Questions should involve finding matches or relationships in a matrix.
- Animation cues should show cell selection and match validation.
