### Template Context: VECTOR_SANDBOX

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Interactive vector manipulation and visualization.
- Vectors are draggable and resizable.
- Operations can be applied to vectors.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Focus on vector mathematics, physics, and spatial relationships.
- Visual elements should represent vectors as arrows with magnitude and direction.
- Questions should involve vector operations or understanding vector properties.
- Animation cues should show vector manipulation and operation results.
