### Template Context: IMAGE_HOTSPOT_QA

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- An interactive image with clickable hotspots.
- Each hotspot reveals a question when clicked.
- Questions test knowledge about specific regions or features of the image.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Focus on a rich, detailed image with multiple points of interest.
- Visual elements should highlight different regions or features.
- Questions should be location-specific and test spatial knowledge.
- Animation cues should include hotspot highlighting and modal transitions.
