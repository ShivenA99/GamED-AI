### Template Context: PARAMETER_PLAYGROUND

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Interactive playground to adjust parameters and see results.
- Parameters are controlled via sliders or inputs.
- Visualization updates in real-time based on parameters.
- For algorithm questions, includes step-by-step execution with visual array/graph representation.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Focus on experimentation, parameter adjustment, and cause-effect relationships.
- Visual elements should show how parameters affect outcomes.
- Questions should involve predicting or understanding parameter effects.
- Animation cues should show parameter changes and result updates.

For algorithm visualization questions (binary search, sorting, etc.):
- Extract the data structure (array, graph, etc.) from the question
- Identify the algorithm type and key steps
- Explain how the algorithm works step-by-step
- Describe what each parameter controls (array values, target, etc.)
- Use visual metaphors that help understand the algorithm (e.g., "searching through a rotated treasure map")

Example for rotated sorted array:
- Array: [6,7,8,1,2,3,4,5]
- Target: 3
- Algorithm: Binary search in rotated sorted array
- Key steps: Find sorted half, check if target is in sorted half, search appropriate half
- Visual metaphor: A rotated map where you need to find which section is properly oriented, then search that section
