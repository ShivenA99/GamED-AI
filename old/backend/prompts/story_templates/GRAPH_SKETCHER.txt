### Template Context: GRAPH_SKETCHER

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Draw or manipulate graphs, nodes, and edges.
- Canvas allows drawing and editing graph structures.
- Graph structure is validated on submission.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Emphasize graph structures, networks, and relationships.
- Visual elements should represent nodes and edges.
- Questions should involve constructing or understanding graph structures.
- Animation cues should show node/edge creation and graph validation.
