### Template Context: SEQUENCE_BUILDER

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Drag-and-drop interface to arrange steps in correct order.
- Steps are represented as cards that can be reordered.
- Correct ordering is validated on submission.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Emphasize ordered steps, processes, or sequences.
- Visual elements should represent discrete steps that have a natural order.
- Questions should involve ordering or sequencing tasks.
- Animation cues should show step transitions and correct/incorrect placement.
