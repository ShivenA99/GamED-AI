### Template Context: BEFORE_AFTER_TRANSFORMER

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Compare before and after states with transformation steps.
- Before and after states are displayed side-by-side.
- Transformation steps are selectable or orderable.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Emphasize transformations, processes, and state changes.
- Visual elements should represent before/after states and transformation steps.
- Questions should involve understanding transformations or ordering steps.
- Animation cues should show state transitions, step application, and transformation visualization.
