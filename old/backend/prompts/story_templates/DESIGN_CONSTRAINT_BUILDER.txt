### Template Context: DESIGN_CONSTRAINT_BUILDER

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Design solutions while respecting constraints and requirements.
- Constraints are displayed as requirements.
- Design elements are placed on canvas with constraint validation.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Emphasize problem-solving, constraints, and design optimization.
- Visual elements should represent constraints and design space.
- Questions should involve designing solutions or understanding constraints.
- Animation cues should show constraint violations, design placement, and validation.
