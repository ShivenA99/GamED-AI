### Template Context: MICRO_SCENARIO_BRANCHING

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Interactive branching scenarios with decision points.
- Scenarios present choices that lead to different branches.
- Path taken is tracked and evaluated.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Focus on decision-making, branching narratives, and consequences.
- Visual elements should represent scenarios, choices, and branches.
- Questions should involve making decisions or understanding consequences.
- Animation cues should show scenario transitions, choice selection, and branch paths.
