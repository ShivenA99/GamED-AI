### Template Context: GEOMETRY_BUILDER

The resulting visualization will be implemented as:
- Construct geometric shapes and solve geometry problems.
- Canvas allows drawing geometric shapes.
- Shape properties are validated on submission.

When generating story_context, visual_metaphor, visual_elements, question_flow, and animation_cues:
- Focus on geometric construction, spatial reasoning, and shape properties.
- Visual elements should represent geometric shapes, tools, and construction lines.
- Questions should involve constructing shapes or understanding geometric properties.
- Animation cues should show shape construction, tool usage, and property validation.
