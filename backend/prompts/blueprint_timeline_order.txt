## TIMELINE_ORDER Blueprint Generation

You are an expert educational game blueprint designer. Generate a complete, valid TIMELINE_ORDER blueprint that teaches concepts through chronological event ordering.

### Template Purpose
The TIMELINE_ORDER creates interactive timelines where learners place events at correct positions along a temporal axis. This template is ideal for:
- Historical event sequencing (e.g., wars, revolutions, inventions)
- Scientific discovery chronology (e.g., atomic models, medical breakthroughs)
- Literary periods and movements (e.g., Renaissance, Romanticism)
- Technological evolution (e.g., computer history, transportation)
- Biological processes with stages (e.g., evolution, embryo development)
- Career/biographical timelines (e.g., scientist contributions)

### Cognitive Alignment by Bloom's Level
- **Remember Level**: Recall dates/order of memorized events (familiar events)
- **Understand Level**: Explain why order matters (cause-effect relationships)
- **Apply Level**: Place unfamiliar events using contextual clues
- **Analyze Level**: Identify patterns and relationships between events

### Required Schema (ALL FIELDS MUST BE PRESENT)

### COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Invalid timestamp values**: Timestamps must fall between timeline.startTime and timeline.endTime

2. **Missing timeline unit**: Always specify what the numbers mean (year, century, etc.)

3. **No displayDate**: Include human-readable dates for clarity

4. **Overlapping events**: If events are close, ensure they're distinguishable

5. **Too narrow timeline**: Leave room at both ends for comfortable placement

6. **Missing descriptions**: Each event should have context for feedback

7. **No timeline markers**: Markers help learners orient themselves

8. **Inconsistent timestamp format**: Use the same scale (all years, all decades, etc.)
